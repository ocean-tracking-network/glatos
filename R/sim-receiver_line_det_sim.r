#' @title Simulate detection of acoustic-tagged fish crossing a receiver line
#'
#' @description
#' Estimate, by simulation, the probability of detecting an acoustic-tagged
#' fish on a receiver line, given constant fish velocity (ground speed),
#' receiver spacing, number of receivers, and detection range curve.
#'
#' @param vel A numeric scalar with fish velocity in meters per second.
#'
#' @param delayRng A 2-element numeric vector with minimum and maximum delay
#'   (time in seconds from end of one coded burst to beginning of next)
#'
#' @param burstDur A numeric scalar with duration (in seconds) of each coded
#'   burst (i.e., pulse train).
#'
#' @param recSpc A numeric vector with distances (in meters) between receivers.
#'   The length of vector is N-1, where N is number of receivers. One receiver
#'   is simulated when `recSpc = NA` (default).
#'
#' @param maxDist A numeric scalar with maximum distance between tagged fish
#'   and any receiver during simulation (i.e., sets spatial boundaries)
#'
#' @param rngFun A function that defines detection range curve; must accept a
#'   numeric vector of distances and return a numeric vector of detection
#'   probabilities at each distance.
#'
#' @param outerLim A two-element numeric vector with space (in meters) in which
#'   simulated fish are allowed to pass to left (first element) and right
#'   (second element) of the receiver line.
#'
#' @param nsim Integer scalar with the number of crossings (fish) to simulate
#'
#' @param showPlot A logical scalar. Should a plot be drawn showing receivers
#'   and fish paths?
#'
#' @details
#' Virtual tagged fish (N=`nsim`) are "swum" through a virtual receiver
#' line. The first element of `recSpc` determines spacing between first
#' two receivers in the line, and each subsequent element of `recSpc`
#' determine spacing of subsequent receivers along the line, such that the
#' number of receivers is equal to `length(recSpc) + 1`. Each fish moves
#' at constant velocity (`vel`) along a line perpendicular to the
#' receiver line. The location of each fish path along the receiver line is
#' random (drawn from uniform distribution), and fish can pass outside the
#' receiver line (to the left of the first receiver or right of last receiver)
#' if `outerLim[1]` or `outerLim[2]` are greater than 0 meters.
#' Each fish starts and ends about `maxDist` meters from the receiver
#' line.
#'
#' @details
#' A simulated tag signal is transmitted every `delayRng[1]` to
#' `delayRng[2]` seconds. At time of each transmission, the distance is
#' calculated between the tag and each receiver, and rngFun is used to
#' calculate the probability (p) that the signal was detected on each receiver.
#' Detection or non-detection on each receiver is determined by a draw from a
#' Bernoulli distribution with probability p.
#'
#' @return A data frame with one column:
#'   \item{detProb}{The proportion of simulated fish that were detected more
#'   than once on any single receiver.}

#' # EXAMPLE 3 - summarize detection probability vs. fish swim speed
#'
#' # define scenarios of fish movement rate
