#' Generate the residence index from a set of detections
#'
#' This residence index tool will take condensed detection event data (from
#' [detection_events()] and caculate the residence index for each
#' location. The information passed to the function is
#' what is used to calculate the residence index, make sure you are only passing
#' the data you want taken into consideration for the residence index (i.e.
#' species, stations, tags, etc.).

#'
#' @param detections A data.frame from the [detection_events()]
#'   function.
#'
#' @param calculation_method A character string with the calculation method
#'   using one of the following: `kessel`, `time_interval`,
#'   `timedelta`, `aggregate_with_overlap`, or
#'   `aggregate_no_overlap`.
#'
#' @param locations An optional data frame that identifies all unique
#' locations where RI will be calculated. Three columns required:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{location}{Character string with unique location identifier.}
#'   \item{mean_longitude}{Location longitude (for mapping).}
#'   \item{mean_latitude}{Location latitude (for mapping).}
#' }
#'
#' If `locations = NULL` (default value) then RI will only be
#' calculated at locations present in `detections$location`.
#'
#' @param group_col Optional character string (can be multiple) that identifies
#' additional grouping variables for RI calculations. The default value
#' (`group_col = "animal_id"`) will calculate and return RI for each
#'  animal at each location (i.e., for each unique combination of
#'  `location` and `animal_id`. If `group_col = NULL` then
#'  RI will be calculated by location only (will not account for animal or
#'  any other variable).
#'
#' @param time_interval_size Character string with size of the time interval
#' used when `calculation_method = "time_interval"`. This is passed to
#' [seq.Date][base::seq.Date]'s `by` argument, so must meet the requirements of
#' that argument for that function (e.g., "1 day", "4 hours", etc.). Default is
#' `"1 day"`.
#'
#' @param groupwise_total Logical that determines how the denominator is
#' calculated in RI. If FALSE (default) then the denominator represents the
#' total number of time intervals or time (depending on calculation method)
#' among all records. Otherwise (if FALSE), the denominator
#' represents the total number of time intervals or time within each
#' group level (e.g., for each animal if `group_col = "animal_id"`.
#'
#' @details The **kessel** method converts both the `first_detection`
#' and `last_detection` columns into a date with no hours, minutes, or
#' seconds. Next it creates a list of the unique days where a detection was
#' seen. The size of the list is returned as the total number of days as an
#' integer. This calculation is used to determine the total number of distinct
#' days (T) and the total number of distinct days per location (S). Possible
#' rounding error may occur as a detection on 2016-01-01 23:59:59 and a
#' detection on 2016-01-02 00:00:01 would be counted as two days when it is
#' really 2-3 seconds.
#'
#' \deqn{ RI = S/T}
#' \deqn{ RI = Residence Index}
#' \deqn{S = Distinct number of days detected at the location}
#' \deqn{T = Distinct number of days detected at any location}
#'
#' @details The **time_interval** calculation method determines the
#'   number of time intervals (size determined by `time_interval_size`
#'   argument) in which detections occurred at each `location` and as a
#'   fraction of the number of time intervals in which detections occurred
#'   among all sites. For each location, residency index (RI) is calculated:
#'
#' \deqn{ RI = L/T}
#' \deqn{ RI = Residence Index}
#' \deqn{L = Distinct number of time intervals in which detection observed at
#'           this location}
#' \deqn{T = Distinct number of time intervals in which detection observed at
#'           any location}
#'
#'   For consistency with other `calculation_method`s,
#'   the L and T are not reported, but are converted cumulative time covered in
#'   days and reported in columns `days_detected` and `total_days`.
#'
#'
#' @details The **timedelta** calculation method determines the first
#' detection and the last detection of all detections. The time difference is
#' then taken as the values to be used in calculating the residence index. The
#' timedelta for each station is divided by the timedelta of the array to
#' determine the residence index.
#'
#' \deqn{
#' RI = Delta S/Delta T}
#'
#' \deqn{RI = Residence Index}
#'
#' \deqn{Delta S = Last detection time at the location - First detection time at the location}
#'
#' \deqn{Delta T = Last detection time at any location - First detection time at any location}
#'
#'
#' @details
#' The **aggregate_with_overlap** calculation method takes the length of time of each
#' detection and sums them together. A total is returned. The sum for each location
#' is then divided by the sum among all locations to determine the residence index.
#'
#' \deqn{
#' RI = AwOS/AwOT}
#'
#' \deqn{RI = Residence Index}
#'
#' \deqn{AwOS = Sum of length of time of each detection at the location}
#'
#' \deqn{AwOT = Sum of length of time of each detection among all locations}
#'
#'
#' @details
#' The **aggregate_no_overlap** calculation method takes the length of time of each
#' detection and sums them together. However, any overlap in time between one or
#' more detections is excluded from the sum. For example, if the first detection
#' is from `2016-01-01 01:02:43` to `2016-01-01 01:10:12` and the second
#' detection is from `2016-01-01 01:09:01 `to `2016-01-01 01:12:43`, then the
#' sum of those two detections would be 10 minutes. A total is returned once all
#' detections of been added without overlap. The sum for each location is then
#' divided by the sum among all locations to determine the residence index.
#'
#' \deqn{
#' RI = AnOS/AnOT}
#'
#' \deqn{RI = Residence Index}
#'
#' \deqn{AnOS = Sum of length of time of each detection at the location, excluding any overlap}
#'
#' \deqn{AnOT = Sum of length of time of each detection among all locations, excluding any overlap}
