# Description -----

#' Detection Range Probability Model
#'
#' Uses a third-order polynomial, logit, or, probit model to
#' determine detection range based on a expected percentage of detections
#' for acoustic telemetry receivers. This function is to be used after a
#' preliminary range test which uses multiple distances away from
#' representative receiver. Preliminary detection efficiency is to be
#' determined in Vemco's Range Testing software and exported as a csv.
#
#' @param formula an object of class \code{formula} or one that can be coerced
#' to that class): a symbolic description of the model to be fitted.
#' The details of model specification are given under Details.
#'
#' @param data an optional data frame, list or environment (or object coercible
#' by as.data.frame to a data frame) containing the variables in the model.
#' If not found in data, the variables are taken from environment(formula),
#' typically the environment from which \code{detection_range_model()} is called.
#'
#' @param percentage a given percentage of expected detections to be heard
#' by representative receiver. For example a value of 50 will calculate the
#' distance at which 50% of a range tag is expected to be heard by a
#' representative receiver. If more than one percentage value is wanted,
#' specify by creating a vector. Percentages can be calculated down to the
#' 1e-16 of a percentage (e.g. 99.9). However, the closer you approach 0 or 100
#' the less accurate the model becomes. The resulting dataframe may round the
#' display, if it does just call the specific column desired.
#'
#' @param link default is \code{"polynomial"} which  will  use and return a
#' third order polynomial model. However, if a logit or probit model is
#' desired the argument can be supplied with  \code{"logit"} or
#'  \code{"probit"} and will return a logit or probit model. See Details about
#'  y variable format depending on which link is chosen.
#'
#' @param subset allows for the data to be subsetted if desired. Default set
#' to `NULL` and does not need to be supplied.
#'
#' @param summary_stats default is set to \code{TRUE} resulting in all summary
#' statistics of the model to be returned. If set to \code{FALSE}, summary
#' statistics of the model will not be displayed. Summary statistics should
#' always be evaluated, however the argument exists solely to shorten the
#' dataframe in the need to quickly look at predicted distances. Use with caution.
#'
#' @param model_frame  argument call is only required when link is set to
#' \code{"polynomial"} default is \code{"data_frame"}. See details about
#' polynomial \code{formula} call and when it is appropriate to use
#' \code{"data_frame"} or \code{"matrix"}.
#' @details If a third order polynomial model is selected, the formula call
#' can be in two different formats. The preferred and default format is
#' \code{y ~ -1 + x + I(x ^ 2) + I(x ^ 3) + offset(y-intercept)}. \code{model_frame}
#' needs to be set \code{"data_frame"}to properly extract
#' parameters and determine distances away from a receiver given a percentage
#' of interest. If using the \code{base::poly()} within the formula as such
#' \code{y ~ -1 + poly(x, 3, raw = TRUE) + offset(y-intercept)}, then
#' \code{model_frame} argument needs to be set to \code{"matrix"}.
#' Both formula formats have \code{offset()} which sets the  y-intercept.
#' The y-intercept needs to be set to 100, as x = 0 m away from a receiver
#' you expect to hear a tag 100\% of the time.
#'
#' A third order polynomial will handle preliminary detection efficiency
#' percentages (y variable) as whole numbers as the model is not bound by
#' 0 and 1. While both logit and probit models have to use percentages as
#' decimals as the models are bound by 0 and 1.
#'
#' Additionally, its been noticed that with fewer data points a third order
#' polynomial often fits the data better however this does not mean that neither
#' a logit or probit model should not be assessed as well.
#'
#'
#' @return A tibble object that consists of the percentage of interest, the predicted
#' distance from the model, and model summary statistics:
#'
#' If a third order polynomial is selected the following summary statistics are displayed:
#' degrees of freedom, chi-square test, person's goodness of fit test,
#' slopes, slopes' standard error, slopes' p-value, residual standard error,
#' r squared and adjusted r squared values, and aic value.
#'
#' If a logit or probit model is selected the following summary statistics are displayed:
#' degrees of freedom, chi-square (deviance), person's goodness of fit test,
#' slope, slope's standard error, slope's p-value, z-value, null deviance, and aic value.
